Changes we made: 
1. Using the tiniest model possible (potentially we could use a mid sized model for inference)
2. Making the fixes to the library as stated by this following webpage https://github.com/sanchit-gandhi/whisper-jax/issues/122
3. We're going to have to download ffmpeg to the system; let's try one more time
4. Updating ffmpeg is required
